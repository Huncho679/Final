# Project Setup Instructions

**Usage**: Please follow these instructions to set up and run the project:

1. **Open the Entire "Final" Folder**: 
   Open the entire project (or not but that's how I did it) in your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

2. **Start the Server**:
   - Navigate to the "Server" folder.
   - Open a terminal within the "Server" directory.
   - Execute the following command to start the server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - You will receive an indication in the console when the server and database have successfully started.

3. **Start the Todo List Application**:
   - Navigate to the "Client" folder.
   - Open a terminal within the "Client" directory.
   - Execute the following command to start the Todo List application:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   
4. **Ensure Both Server and Client are Running**:
   - It is crucial to have both the server and the client running simultaneously for the project to work correctly.
   - Make sure that the server is running first before starting the client application.
   - Two users are provided for the sake of demonstrating login (planning to implement the creation of users a bit later) each with their own set of independent tasks.
   - The first user is "coujo" and the password is "pass@123". The second user is "Kiki345" and the password is "orange787".
  
   **Note: It might be necessary to reinstall node modules by running "npm i" in either folder once you enter the directory**
